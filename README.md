# hello-world
this is telling the world "hello"

so like i was saying, the other day i went to the park and there was this huge dinosaur there and i asked him what his name was and he said thomas. normally i would be scared of t-rexes but he was chomping on a massive carrot and he told me they were just a misunderstood species.
